# Password-manager
This is my first program. It's pretty simple, but it's what I was only able to do with my current python level.

The main program is contras.py and the other file is the one in charge of encrypting the information.

The program is in spanish because that is my first language. But is pretty simple. First the program ask for a global pass to acces to the menu.
After that the menu have 5 option.

The first let you add a new password to the list. This will create a file.txt if one doesn't exist.
in this file the user will be written as is. But the password will be encrypted.

The second option let you know the password for a specific site or username that is already in the list

The third option let you change a password that is already in the list.

The fourth option print the entire list of usernames and passwords

And the final option will generate a random password of the length given.
